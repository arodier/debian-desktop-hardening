# Debian Workstation Hardening playbooks

This repository allows you to harden your Debian workstation, without breaking it.

It is embryonic, and contains only what I need for now.

## Components

- Partitions locking (e.g. /usr as ro)
- Firefox profile (minimal, a lot of things are not permitted)
- Evolution profile (idem)
